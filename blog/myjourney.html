            <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
            <h5>April 17, 2022</h5>
            <img src="static/images/joshua.JPG" class="img-responsive" style="width:30%" alt="Image">
            <p>Prior to year 11 I always said to myself ' i'm going to be rich, i'm going to have money ' , 
               however looking back now I had no idea why I thought this , I didn't even know what I wanted to do. 
            </p>
            <p>Then came year 11. My school started to offer Computer Science to the year 10s and 1 class in year 11.
               I have always been interested in computers and programming however I never tried to learn it. 
               Anyways I decided to take it and at the end of year 11 I got a decent grade. I really enjoyed it so I picked Computer Science for ALevels.

            </p>
            <p>In sixth form I studied Accounting , Chemistry and Computer Science but Computer Science was by far what I enjoyed the most.
               I knew I wanted to study it at university. I was an A student in both Accounting and Computer Science however in Chemistry I wasn't the best student. I averaged around a low C.
               I was easily distracted in Chemistry and my first mistake was instead of trying to understand the topics I struggled on , I just ignored it and focused on Computer Science. Little did I know this would come back to bite me, 
               my Chemistry teacher wasn't the best in my opinion so I felt this had an impact on my learning. 
            </p>
            <p>Back to Computer Science, In year 12 we learned the basics such as operating systems , bit manipulation and basic algorithms. We also coded this using pyhton.
               I didn't struggle with this although what I wish I did from the start was before each algorthim question I understood what I needed to do and write down the steps to achieve this. This would of helped me a lot when solving complex algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>Year 13 is where it got interesting. In Computer Science we started our coursework. I decided to make a resturant website using Python Flask. This went well. We also started to go into depth with Data Structures and Algorithms. If I could speak to my year 13 self I would tell him to focus on this as it is so so important.
               Year 13 is where I started applying for university and it was pretty easy for me. I knew what I wanted to study and I knew where I wanted to go. I wanted to go Loughborough to study Computer Science. All I needed to do was get the grades. I still was struggling with Chemistry however I had the mentality of that I was going to pass anyways. This is where it started going wrong.
            </p>
            <p>As we all know around January/Febuary 2020 the global pandemic started and schools shut. It was announced that we wouldn't do exams and that teachers will give us our grade. After that happened I stopped trying and didn't go to online lessons(Even though teachers said we should attend as we could still improve our grade)
               One of my biggest regrets I have is not learning a skill Computer Science related during the 5+ months we were stuck inside. Instead I started reselling , I made a lot of money however if I learned a skill such as mastering Data Structures and Algorithms I would have a headstart when applying for internships. 
               When results day hit I was nervous however I was pretty confident I was going to get into Loughborough , I opened UCAS and I saw I didn't get in. I checked my grade and I got an E for Chemistry. 
               I was upset especially when I saw so many people getting into their chosen university. 
               I had to go through clearing and I was very fortunate to be able to get into University of Leicester for Computer Science.
               This was a wake up call for me. I decided I was going to be serious and not take my education for granted.
            </p>
            <p>I averaged a first in my first year and I learned a lot of new things. For example I made a reselling website for my trainers and I learnt Java and Javascript.
                Nevertheless I made another personal mistake. It was not doing a summer internship after first year. Getting experience and internships on your resume is so important. You have the opportunity to learn new stuff , network with people in the industry and even get paid. 

            </p>
            <p>In second year I made it my personal goal to get 2 internships , 1 for the summer and 1 industry placement. After countless interviews and rejections I managed to secure 2. These past 6 months have taught me a lot. It showed me the importance of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms and it showed me 
               the importance of networking , having a professional informative CV and Linkedin. 
               I start my first internship at Pirum on tuesday and this is the start of my successful career as a Software Engineer.
               I hope my experience helps you not make any of the mistakes I made.
            </p>

                Thank you for reading.
